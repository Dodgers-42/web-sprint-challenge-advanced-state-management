How to set a project with Components.. w/ Action and Reducer Files

1. Start with the Componentâ€¦
        This is where you figure out what information you need and or want to display

2 .Actions File..
        This is where you do your axios calls. This is where you get your data, your functions for getting, modifying, or deleting data

dispatch({type: FETCH_START})  dispatch({type: FETCH_SUCCESS, payload: res.data})

3. Reducer File

    case FETCH_START:                case FETCH_SUCCESS:
    return {                         return{
    ... state                        ...state,
    isFetching:true                  isFetching: false, 
}                                    photos: action.payload.photos
                                     dogs: actions.payload.dogs
                                     }
